## Meowshell

This repository contains my personal Fish shell configuration, designed for a consistent and efficient experience across multiple operating systems (Linux, macOS, and Windows).

This setup is managed and deployed using a single Python script (setup_fish.py), which handles installation, configuration backup, and symlinking.
